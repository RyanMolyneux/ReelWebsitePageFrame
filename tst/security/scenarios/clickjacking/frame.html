        <h1> CLICK JACKING MITIGATION TEST CURRENT ORIGIN PAGE</h1>
        <p> Manually check to ensure that the below iframe does allow for the request to load if "Hello World"  
            shown within that means that something is wrong with the native backend that is causing html page
            responses that should not be aloud to load at this origin to load at this origin and this must be
            corrected as it can open the users of the library to vulnerability of clickjacking or worse if
            the modifications to the header are not the only modifications that where made.</p>
